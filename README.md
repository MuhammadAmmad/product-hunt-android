# Product Hunt Android
This is an open-source effort to build an [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hhua.android.producthunt) for [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/).

## Download

Download me on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hhua.android.producthunt)

## Why am I building this?

1. [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/) does not have an official app for Android.
2. I am a [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/) fan.
3. I was going through the mobile training track from [Groupon](https://www.groupon.com/) and looking for something as capstone project.

## Why am I open-sourcing it?

1. I got help all around from open-source community, and it is time for me to help back.
2. The rate limit on [Product Hunt API](https://api.producthunt.com/v1/docs) makes it impossible for this app to scale to a big crowd of users. Opensourcing the app could allow any hobbyist to use their own API keys to build the app.
3. A big problem of hobby projects is they lack continuity. I believe open sourcing the app could allow this app to be kept improving.
4. Another problem of third-party apps is about privacy and transparency. Since this is an app for the [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/) community, I believe it is better supervised by the community.

## Notable Issues

1. You cannot vote/comment on a post yet. The app is waiting for whitelisting by [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/).
