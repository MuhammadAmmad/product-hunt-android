{"name":"Oh My Product Hunt","tagline":"An open-sourced Android client for Product Hunt (unofficial)","body":"# Oh My Product Hunt\r\nThis is an open-source effort to build an [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hhua.android.producthunt) for [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/).\r\n\r\n![Screenshots](https://github.com/hhua/product-hunt-android/blob/master/public/img/screenshots_mixed.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n## Download\r\n\r\nDownload me on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hhua.android.producthunt)\r\n\r\n## Why am I building this?\r\n\r\n1. [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/) does not have an official app for Android.\r\n2. I am a [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/) fan.\r\n3. I was going through the mobile training track from [Groupon](https://www.groupon.com/) and looking for something as capstone project.\r\n\r\n## Why am I open-sourcing it?\r\n\r\n1. I got help all around from open-source community, and it is time for me to help back.\r\n2. The rate limit on [Product Hunt API](https://api.producthunt.com/v1/docs) makes it impossible for this app to scale to a big crowd of users. Opensourcing the app could allow any hobbyist to use their own API keys to build the app.\r\n3. A big problem of hobby projects is they lack continuity. I believe open sourcing the app could allow this app to be kept improving.\r\n4. Another problem of third-party apps is about privacy and transparency. Since this is an app for the [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/) community, I believe it is better supervised by the community.\r\n\r\n## Notable Issues\r\n\r\n1. You cannot vote/comment on a post yet. The app is waiting for whitelisting by [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/). \r\n\r\nMore problems are tracked [here](https://github.com/hhua/product-hunt-android/issues)\r\n\r\n## How to Contribute\r\n\r\nAll bugs and ideas are more than welcome to be added [here](https://github.com/hhua/product-hunt-android/issues)\r\n\r\n**Documentation Coming Soon**\r\n\r\n## Related Blog Posts\r\n\r\n**Coming Soon**\r\n\r\n\r\n## Thanks\r\n1.
